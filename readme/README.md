# Capstone Project: Random Forest Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the capstone project for the Master’s Program at the **University of West Florida (UWF)**.  
The project explores the application of the **Random Forest algorithm**, a widely used ensemble learning method, to solve a data-driven research problem.

## Objectives
- Investigate the strengths and limitations of Random Forest.  
- Apply the algorithm to a real-world dataset.  
- Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics.  
- Provide insights into parameter tuning and model interpretation.  

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → Raw and processed datasets.  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (Python) and R scripts for analysis.  
- `src/` → Source code in Python and R for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `results/` → Output files, figures, and tables generated during the analysis.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).  

## Software

You can run this project using **either Python or R**.
