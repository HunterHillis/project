# **Waves in a forest: a random forest classifier to distinguish between gravitational waves and detector glitches**

The paper aims to improve the classification of gravitational wave signals (GWs) against non-astrophysical noise, known as glitches. This distinction is critical because detectors like LIGO often record large amounts of noise events, and misidentifying them as GWs could hinder astrophysical discoveries. A reliable machine learning framework for separating these signals is therefore highly valuable for gravitational wave astronomy.

To address this challenge, the authors use two datasets: simulated GWs and five classes of real glitches from the GravitySpy project. They apply Bayesian inference to each event to estimate the posterior distributions of the waveform parameters. From these posteriors, they extract a rich set of features, including the mode, median, credible interval widths (68% and 95%), skewness, and pairwise correlations. This preprocessing step converts complex posterior distributions into structured feature vectors, resulting in about 200 numerical features per event. These values are merged into a single dataset.

The classification is performed using a Random Forest with 100 decision trees, using the Gini index to guide the splits. To prevent overfitting, the algorithm randomly samples subsets of features at each split, providing automatic feature selection. The training dataset is split 70/30 between training and testing, and to mitigate class imbalance (since glitches outnumber signals), SMOTE is applied to generate synthetic minority class samples. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the train/test process is repeated 100 times, and median confusion matrices are generated for evaluation.

The classifier achieves high accuracy (around 93â€“94%) with a low false negative rate for GWs, indicating that true signals are rarely misclassified. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest classifier can effectively distinguish simulated GWs from real glitches using features derived from posterior distributions, achieving high accuracy while controlling false negatives, without needing to operate directly on the raw waveform data.
